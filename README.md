This is a terminal text editor made in C++. The purpose of this project is to learn how a text editor application works and refine my skills in C++. I will be using the ncurses library to develop this editor.

TODO: v0.1
- create buffer to store user keyboard input.
- display buffer on screen.
- add exit functionality to exit the text editor. Will work by first detecting esc key then x to exit.
- possibly add save feature when exiting to write to a file and resume editing file when text editor opens again
